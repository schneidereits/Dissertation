# CC-9-Data-clustering

## This repository holds the data necessary to complete Coding Club's Intro to Data clustering tutorial, available here:
## https://ourcodingclub.github.io/2017/03/21/data-clustering.html

The data come from a dataset called NeoTropTree. NeoTropTree has been developed by <a href="http://prof.icb.ufmg.br/treeatlan/">Professor Ary Oliveira-Filho (Federal University of Minas Gerais - Brazil)</a>. NeoTropTree is a large database containing records on tree species composition, gathered by reviewing the literature (published and unpublished - e.g. masters dissertations and PhD theses), compiling species check-lists, and studying herbarium records. Each site within the database has been assigned to a specific vegetation type (an ecologically meaningful unit).

We would love to hear your feedback on the tutorial, whether you did it at a Coding Club workshop or online:
