###### Helpfull packages

- the packages **Rcpp** and **reticulate** enable access to C++ and Python code, for example. This means R can be used as a      ‘bridge’ to a wide range of geospatial programs (see Section 1.3).

- This overview described packages for spatial smoothing and interpolation, including akima and geoR (Akima and Gebhardt 2016; Jr and Diggle 2016)
