# PCA

# Load the community dataset which we`ll use in the examples today
data(varespec)

# Open the dataset and look if you can find any patterns
View(varespec)
# It is probably very difficult to see any patterns by just looking at the data frame!

# With this command, you`ll perform a NMDS and plot the results

PCA <- rda(varespec, scale = FALSE)
# Use scale = TRUE if your variables are on different scales (e.g. for abiotic variables).
# Here, all species are measured on the same scale 
# So use scale = FALSE

# Now plot a bar plot of relative eigenvalues. This is the percentage variance explained by each axis
barplot(as.vector(PCA$CA$eig)/sum(PCA$CA$eig)) 
# How much of the variance in our dataset is explained by the first principal component?

# Calculate the percent of variance explained by first two axes
sum((as.vector(PCA$CA$eig)/sum(PCA$CA$eig))[1:2]) # 79%, this is ok.
# Also try to do it for the first three axes

# Now, we`ll plot our results with the plot function
plot(PCA)
plot(PCA, display = "sites", type = "points")
plot(PCA, display = "species", type = "text")
# plotting both
plot(PCA, display = c("sites", "species"), type = "points")

# You can extract the species and site scores on the new PC for further analyses:
sitePCA <- PCA$CA$u # Site scores
speciesPCA <- PCA$CA$v # Species scores

# In a biplot of a PCA, species' scores are drawn as arrows 
# that point in the direction of increasing values for that variable
biplot(PCA, choices = c(1,2), type = c("text", "points"), xlim = c(-5,10)) # biplot of axis 1 vs 2
biplot(PCA, choices = c(1,3), type = c("text","points")) # biplot of axis 1 vs 3

# Check out the help file how to pimp your biplot further:
?biplot.rda

# You can even go beyond that, and use the ggbiplot package.
# You can install this package by running:
#library(devtools)
#install_github("ggbiplot", "vqv")
#library(ggbiplot)

# First step is to calculate a distance matrix. 
# Here we use Bray-Curtis distance metric

# principle cordinate analysis

# PCoA is not included in vegan. 
# We will use the ape package instead

sum((as.vector(PCA$CA$eig)/sum(PCA$CA$eig))[1:2]) # 79%
sum((as.vector(PCA$CA$eig)/sum(PCA$CA$eig))[1:3]) # 86%

# Some distance measures may result in negative eigenvalues. In that case, add a correction:
PCOA <- pcoa(dist, correction = "cailliez")

# Plot your results
biplot.pcoa(PCOA)

# You see what`s missing? 
# Indeed, there are no species plotted on this biplot. 
# That's because we used a dissimilarity matrix (sites x sites) 
# as input for the PCOA function. 
# Hence, no species scores could be calculated. 
#However, we could work around this problem like this:
biplot.pcoa(PCOA, varespec)

# Extract the plot scores from first two PCoA axes (if you need them):
PCOAaxes <- PCOA$vectors[,c(1,2)]

# Compare this result with the PCA plot
par(mfrow = c(1, 2)) 
biplot.pcoa(PCOA)
plot(PCA)

# reset plot window
par(mfrow = c(1, 1)) 

# non-metric multidimentional scaling

# Methodology of NMDS:
  
#Step 1: Perform NMDS with 1 to 10 dimensions

#Step 3: Choose optimal number of dimensions
#Step 4: Perform final NMDS with that number of dimensions
#Step 5: Check for convergent solution and final stress

# performs a NMDS for 1-10 dimensions and plots the nr of dimensions vs the stress
